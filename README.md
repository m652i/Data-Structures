# Data-Structures
Data structures, class and homework codes.

In the past, my uploaded work has been copied by other students, so I will no longer include class names or school name of the current program I am in. 

Problem solving practices are like vaccines, practicing easier problems in advance will help you learn how to solve big problems in the future. 

Copying others' work is like skipping vaccines, but still mark on the card as if you have recieved one. But when the real problem comes, you will not be able to find a solution. 

P.S. Vax do not give autism

Good day!
